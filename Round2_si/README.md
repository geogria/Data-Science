# Some suppliments on Deep Learning

The papers in this folder are in three categories:
- General monographs on DL: Yoshua's monograph and a monograph by Li Deng and Dong Yu;
- Simulation results: The suplementary materials of Hinton's science paper and a paper by Erhan;
- Extensions of Deep Belief Networks and Deep Auto-encoders: two papers about recommender system (kailu_report and netflixICML), and one paper about DBN combined with SVM (alsvm).

To have a *general* idea of Deep learning, my recommendation is to begin with the two papers by Hinton (you can find them in Bo's folder), then read the monograph by Li Deng and Dong Yu.
